### Responsive resize utilities with Tailwind CSS breakpoints

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/resize

Combine resize utilities with responsive breakpoint variants like md: to apply different resize behaviors at specific screen sizes. This example prevents resizing on small screens and enables resizing on medium screens and above.

```html
<div class="resize-none md:resize ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```
