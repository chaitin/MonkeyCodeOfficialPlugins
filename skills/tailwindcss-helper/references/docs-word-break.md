### Apply responsive word breaking with Tailwind CSS

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/word-break

Demonstrates how to use responsive variants like `md:` to apply `word-break` utilities conditionally based on screen size. This example sets `break-normal` by default and switches to `break-all` on medium screens and above, allowing for adaptive text layout.

```html
<p class="break-normal md:break-all ...">  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
```
