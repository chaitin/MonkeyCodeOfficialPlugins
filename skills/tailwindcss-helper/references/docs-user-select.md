### Responsive user-select with breakpoint variants

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/user-select

Applies user-select utilities conditionally at different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS breakpoint variants like md:. This example disables selection on small screens and enables select-all behavior on medium screens and above.

```html
<div class="select-none md:select-all ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```
