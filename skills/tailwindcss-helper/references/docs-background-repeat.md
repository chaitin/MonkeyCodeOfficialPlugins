### Responsive background-repeat with Tailwind CSS breakpoints

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-repeat

Apply different background-repeat utilities at different screen sizes using breakpoint variants like md:. This example repeats the background on all sizes but switches to horizontal-only repeat at medium screens and above.

```html
<div class="bg-repeat md:bg-repeat-x ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```
