### Responsive background-origin with breakpoint variants

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-origin

Apply background-origin utilities responsively by prefixing with breakpoint variants like md:. This example shows how to use bg-origin-border by default and switch to bg-origin-padding at medium screen sizes and above.

```html
<div class="bg-origin-border md:bg-origin-padding ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```
