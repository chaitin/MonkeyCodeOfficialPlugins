### Responsive hyphens utility with breakpoint variant

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hyphens

Apply hyphens utilities responsively by prefixing with a breakpoint variant like md:. This example prevents hyphenation on small screens and enables automatic hyphenation at medium screen sizes and above.

```html
<p class="hyphens-none md:hyphens-auto ...">  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
```
