### Apply responsive font-weight with breakpoint variants

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-weight

Use breakpoint prefixes like md: to apply font-weight utilities conditionally at different screen sizes. This enables responsive typography that adapts to device width.

```html
<p class="font-normal md:font-bold ...">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
```
