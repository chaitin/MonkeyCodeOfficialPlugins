### Apply Tailwind CSS color scheme utilities conditionally in dark mode

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/color-scheme

Illustrates how to use a `dark:` variant with `color-scheme` utilities to apply a different scheme when the system is in dark mode. This enables dynamic theme switching, for example, setting a light scheme by default and switching to dark when the user's system preference is dark.

```html
<html class="scheme-light dark:scheme-dark ...">  <!-- ... --></html>
```
