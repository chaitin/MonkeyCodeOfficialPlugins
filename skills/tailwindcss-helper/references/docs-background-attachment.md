### Responsive background-attachment with breakpoint variants

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-attachment

Apply background-attachment utilities responsively using breakpoint prefixes like md:, lg:, etc. This example uses bg-local by default and switches to bg-fixed at medium screen sizes and above.

```html
<div class="bg-local md:bg-fixed ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```
