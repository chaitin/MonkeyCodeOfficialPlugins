### Apply Responsive Invert Filter with Tailwind CSS Breakpoints

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/filter-invert

Use breakpoint variants like md: to apply invert filter utilities conditionally at specific screen sizes. This example applies full inversion on small screens and no inversion on medium screens and above.

```html
<img class="invert md:invert-0 ..." src="/img/mountains.jpg" />
```
