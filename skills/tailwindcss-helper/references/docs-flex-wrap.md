### Apply Responsive Flex Wrap Utilities with Tailwind CSS

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-wrap

Implement responsive design by prefixing `flex-wrap` utilities with breakpoint variants like `md:`. This allows you to apply different wrapping behaviors based on screen sizes, for example, `flex-wrap` by default and `flex-wrap-reverse` on medium screens and above.

```html
<div class="flex flex-wrap md:flex-wrap-reverse ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```
